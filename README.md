## Data Description

For this challenge, you will be predicting a full year worth of sales for three items at two stores located in three different countries. This dataset is completely fictional, but contains many effects you see in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc. The dataset is small enough to allow you to try numerous different modeling approaches.

Good luck!
